# Backend Integration Phase 2 - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully connected Student Dashboard and Equipment Browse to the PostgreSQL backend, and implemented a complete booking system with role-based permissions.

## Completed Work

### 1. Frontend Updates ✅

#### Student Dashboard ([src/portals/student/StudentDashboard.jsx](src/portals/student/StudentDashboard.jsx))
- ✅ Replaced `demoMode` with `bookingsAPI.getAll()`
- ✅ Fetches user bookings from backend API
- ✅ Handles empty states and errors gracefully
- ✅ Displays booking stats (active, pending, total)

#### Equipment Browse ([src/portals/student/EquipmentBrowse.jsx](src/portals/student/EquipmentBrowse.jsx))
- ✅ Replaced `demoMode` with `equipmentAPI.getAll()`
- ✅ Implements backend filters (category, department, status)
- ✅ Fetches real equipment from PostgreSQL (52 items seeded)
- ✅ Search and pagination working with real data

#### Booking Service ([src/services/booking.service.js](src/services/booking.service.js))
- ✅ Replaced all `demoMode` calls with `bookingsAPI`
- ✅ Backend handles conflict detection
- ✅ Backend handles validation
- ✅ Returns enriched booking data (equipment info, user info)

### 2. Backend Bookings System ✅

#### Booking Controller ([backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js](backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js))
**Complete CRUD operations:**
- ✅ `getAllBookings()` - Role-based filtering (students see own, admins see department, master admin sees all)
- ✅ `getBookingById()` - With permission checks
- ✅ `createBooking()` - With conflict detection, date validation
- ✅ `approveBooking()` - Admin only
- ✅ `denyBooking()` - Admin only with reason
- ✅ `returnBooking()` - Mark as completed
- ✅ `deleteBooking()` - Role-based (students can only delete own pending bookings)

**Features:**
- Automatic conflict detection (prevents double bookings)
- Date validation (no past dates, end > start)
- Equipment availability checking
- Complete audit trail (logged to `admin_actions` table)
- Tracking numbers hidden from students
- Department-level permissions for dept admins

#### Booking Routes ([backend/src/routes/bookingRoutes.js](backend/src/routes/bookingRoutes.js))
```
GET    /api/bookings              # List bookings (filtered by role)
GET    /api/bookings/:id          # Get single booking
POST   /api/bookings              # Create booking
PUT    /api/bookings/:id/approve  # Approve (admin only)
PUT    /api/bookings/:id/deny     # Deny (admin only)
PUT    /api/bookings/:id/return   # Mark returned (admin only)
DELETE /api/bookings/:id          # Delete booking
```

#### Auth Middleware Enhancement ([backend/src/middleware/auth.js](backend/src/middleware/auth.js))
- ✅ Added `requireAdmin()` middleware
- ✅ Checks for staff, department_admin, or master_admin roles
- ✅ Used by booking approval/denial/return endpoints

### 3. Database Features

**Role-Based Queries:**
- Students: Only see own bookings
- Staff: See bookings for their department's equipment
- Dept Admins: Manage bookings for their department only
- Master Admin: Full access to all bookings

**Conflict Detection SQL:**
```sql
SELECT id FROM bookings
WHERE equipment_id = $1
  AND status IN ('pending', 'approved')
  AND (
    (start_date <= $2 AND end_date >= $2) OR
    (start_date <= $3 AND end_date >= $3) OR
    (start_date >= $2 AND end_date <= $3)
  )
```

**Enriched Booking Data:**
```sql
SELECT
  b.*,
  u.full_name as user_name, u.email as user_email,
  e.product_name as equipment_name, e.category as equipment_category
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN equipment e ON b.equipment_id = e.id
```

## How to Test

### 1. Start Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Equipment Browsing
1. Open http://localhost:5174/NCADbook/
2. Click "Student" quadrant
3. Navigate to "Browse Equipment"
4. **Expected:** See 52 equipment items from PostgreSQL
5. **Test filters:** Category, department, search
6. **Test pagination:** Should show 20 items per page

### 3. Test Booking Creation
1. Click on any available equipment
2. Click "Book Equipment"
3. Select start and end dates
4. Enter purpose (if required)
5. Submit booking
6. **Expected:** Booking created with status "pending"
7. **Check console:** Should show API request to `POST /api/bookings`

### 4. Test Dashboard Stats
1. Navigate back to Student Dashboard
2. **Expected:** See booking stats updated
3. **Active bookings:** Count of approved bookings
4. **Pending bookings:** Count of pending bookings
5. **Recent activity:** List of recent bookings

### 5. Test Conflict Detection
1. Create a booking for equipment A (e.g., Jan 10-15)
2. Try to create overlapping booking (e.g., Jan 12-17)
3. **Expected:** Error message "Equipment is already booked for this time period"

### 6. Test Admin Approval (TODO - Next Phase)
1. Login as Dept Admin or Master Admin
2. View pending bookings list
3. Approve or deny bookings
4. **Expected:** Booking status updates, student notified

## API Testing (Manual)

### Create Booking
```bash
# 1. Login as student
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/demo-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"student"}' \
  | jq '.token'

# 2. Create booking (use token from above)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "equipment_id": 1,
    "start_date": "2025-10-15",
    "end_date": "2025-10-20",
    "purpose": "Final year project photography shoot for thesis work"
  }'
```

### Get User Bookings
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/bookings
```

### Approve Booking (Admin)
```bash
# 1. Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/demo-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"master_admin"}' \
  | jq '.token'

# 2. Approve booking
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/bookings/1/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## Database Verification

### Check Bookings in PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Connect to database
psql -U ncadbook_user -d ncadbook_db

-- View all bookings
SELECT
  b.id, b.status, b.start_date, b.end_date,
  u.full_name as student,
  e.product_name as equipment
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN equipment e ON b.equipment_id = e.id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;

-- View pending bookings
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE status = 'pending';

-- View admin actions (audit trail)
SELECT
  a.action_type, a.target_type, a.created_at,
  u.full_name as admin
FROM admin_actions a
JOIN users u ON a.admin_id = u.id
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 3: Admin Approval Interface
1. **Staff/Admin Dashboard** - View pending bookings
2. **Booking Cards** - Swipe-to-approve (mobile-first)
3. **Booking Details Modal** - Student info, equipment info, dates
4. **Approval Actions** - Approve/Deny with reason
5. **Email Notifications** - Notify students of approval/denial

### Phase 4: Equipment Management UI
1. **Equipment CRUD UI** - Admin forms for add/edit/delete
2. **Equipment Notes** - Multi-field notes (maintenance, damage, usage)
3. **Status Management** - Available, maintenance, out_of_service
4. **Image Upload** - Equipment photos

### Phase 5: User Management
1. **User List View** - Master Admin only
2. **User CRUD** - Create, edit, delete users
3. **Role Assignment** - Change user roles
4. **Strike System** - Track late returns

### Phase 6: Analytics Dashboard
1. **Equipment Utilization** - Most booked items, utilization rates
2. **Department Stats** - Booking trends by department
3. **CSV/PDF Export** - Reports with date ranges
4. **Filters** - By department, user, date range

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js` - Complete booking CRUD logic
- `BACKEND_INTEGRATION_PHASE2.md` - This documentation

### Modified
- `backend/src/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Full RESTful routes
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` - Added `requireAdmin()`

## Performance Notes

### Database Indexes (Already in place)
- `bookings(user_id)` - Fast user booking lookups
- `bookings(equipment_id)` - Fast conflict detection
- `bookings(status)` - Fast filtering by status
- `equipment(department)` - Fast department filtering

### API Response Times (Expected)
- `GET /api/equipment` - <100ms (52 items)
- `GET /api/bookings` - <50ms (per user)
- `POST /api/bookings` - <150ms (with conflict check)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/approve` - <100ms

### Frontend Optimization
- Pagination: 20 items per page (reduces DOM size)
- Lazy loading: Equipment images load on demand
- Debounced search: 300ms delay reduces API calls

## Security Features

### Authentication
- ✅ JWT tokens with 7-day expiry
- ✅ Token validation on every request
- ✅ Auto-redirect to login on 401

### Authorization
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Department-level permissions
- ✅ Students cannot approve bookings
- ✅ Dept admins limited to their department
- ✅ Master admin has full access

### Data Protection
- ✅ Tracking numbers hidden from students
- ✅ Students cannot see other students' bookings
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- ✅ Complete audit trail in `admin_actions`
