# UI/UX Overhaul - START HERE üöÄ

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** Context-clear-ready, backups complete, plan finalized
**Estimated Time:** 12-18 weeks for complete overhaul

---

## üìã Quick Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Setup
- [x] Memory files merged ([CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) updated with "Bold & Curious" philosophy)
- [x] Codebase analyzed (React 18 + 80+ components)
- [x] Roadmap assessed (Phase I ~70% complete, Phase II needs alignment)
- [x] Backup created (`backup-before-overhaul-2025-10-17` branch + tag)
- [x] Prioritized sprint plan created (4 sprints, 17 priorities)

### üéØ Current State
- **Working System:** 4 portals (Student/Staff/Dept Admin/Master Admin)
- **Tech Stack:** React 18, Vite, Playwright, PostgreSQL + demo mode
- **Design System:** Foundation exists, needs alignment with new style guide
- **Accessibility:** Partial implementation, needs WCAG 2.1 AA audit

---

## üöÄ START HERE: After Context Clear

### Step 1: Restore Context (30 seconds)
Read these files in order:
1. [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Project overview, tech stack, workflows
2. [context/design-principles.md](context/design-principles.md) - "Bold & Curious" philosophy
3. [context/style-guide.md](context/style-guide.md) - Visual specifications
4. [context/ux-patterns.md](context/ux-patterns.md) - Booking flow architecture

### Step 2: Set Up Playwright MCP (5 minutes)
```bash
# Install Playwright MCP
npx @microsoft/playwright-mcp install
```

Configure MCP settings (see [context/playwright-setup.md](context/playwright-setup.md)):
```json
{
  "mcps": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@microsoft/playwright-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSER": "chromium",
        "PLAYWRIGHT_HEADED": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Test it works:
```bash
npm run dev  # Should open http://localhost:5175/NCADbook/
```

### Step 3: Choose Your Starting Point

**RECOMMENDED: Sprint 1 - Foundation Alignment (Weeks 1-2)**

This sprint sets up the infrastructure for efficient visual development:

**Priority 1: Playwright MCP Visual Development** (Day 1)
- Set up MCP (already done in Step 2)
- Create screenshot comparison workflow
- Test navigation and viewport switching

**Priority 2: Style Guide Alignment Audit** (Days 2-3)
- Compare [src/styles/design-tokens.css](src/styles/design-tokens.css) with [context/style-guide.md](context/style-guide.md)
- Identify discrepancies in colors, typography, spacing
- Update design tokens to match style guide

**Priority 3: Accessibility Baseline Audit** (Days 4-5)
- Run `npx playwright test` with @axe-core
- Document WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab order, focus indicators)
- Create remediation backlog

**Priority 4: Component Inventory** (Days 6-10)
- Catalog all 80+ React components
- Map to [context/ux-patterns.md](context/ux-patterns.md) stages
- Identify redesign vs polish needs
- Document missing components

## üîß Daily Workflow (Once Started)

**For every front-end task:**
1. Reference [context/style-guide.md](context/style-guide.md) and [context/ux-patterns.md](context/ux-patterns.md)
2. Use Playwright to navigate and screenshot current state
3. Make changes
4. Screenshot new state at 3 viewports (1440px, 768px, 375px)
5. Check quality gates (from CLAUDE.md):
   - [ ] No console errors/warnings
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation works
   - [ ] Matches style guide specs
   - [ ] CTAs are action-specific
   - [ ] Mobile viewport is usable

**Visual Development Protocol:**
```javascript
// Navigate to page
await page.goto('http://localhost:5175/NCADbook/equipment/browse');
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// Desktop screenshot
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1440, height: 900 });
await page.screenshot({ path: 'review/desktop-before.png', fullPage: true });

// Mobile screenshot
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
await page.screenshot({ path: 'review/mobile-before.png', fullPage: true });
```

## üö® Critical Reminders

### Never Compromise On:
- ‚úÖ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility (4.5:1 contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels)
- ‚úÖ Action-specific CTA labels (no generic "Next" or "Submit" buttons)
- ‚úÖ Desktop-first design (1440px primary, adapt down to mobile)
- ‚úÖ Design token usage (no hardcoded colors/spacing)
- ‚úÖ Quality gates before considering work complete

### Always Reference:
- [context/design-principles.md](context/design-principles.md) - The "why" behind decisions
- [context/style-guide.md](context/style-guide.md) - The "how" for visual implementation
- [context/ux-patterns.md](context/ux-patterns.md) - The booking flow architecture
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Project conventions and workflows

### Development Commands:
```bash
npm run dev                    # Start dev server
npm test                       # Run all Playwright tests
npx playwright test --ui       # Interactive test mode
npm run test:mobile            # Mobile-specific tests
```
