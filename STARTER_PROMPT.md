## Extended Start Prompt (For Major Features)

```
I'm resuming work on NCADbook (NCAD Equipment Booking System).

PROJECT: Equipment booking platform for 1,600 students, "Bold & Curious" design philosophy
LOCATION: c:\Users\Media Admin\AIprojects\NCADbook
BRANCH: master (synced)

üìö READ FIRST (in order):
1. PROJECT_CHECKPOINT.md - Full current status (comprehensive)
2. CLAUDE.md - Project instructions, workflow guidelines, tech stack
3. DEVELOPMENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md - Last session (Oct 20, 2025)
4. context/design-principles.md - Design philosophy for UX work

‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES:
- Phase 1: Core booking system with 4 portals
- Phase 1.5: Fine Management System (‚Ç¨5/day, account holds)
- Phase 1.6: Policy Enforcement (weekly limits, concurrent limits, training)
- Phase 2: Quality Gates (115+ tests: integration, a11y, performance)

üéØ CURRENT STATUS:
- All features committed and pushed to GitHub ‚úÖ
- Database migration ready: backend/migrations/007_add_policy_enforcement.sql
- Test suites established (Playwright + axe-core)
- Zero technical debt
- Ready for Phase 3

‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING ACTION:
Run database migration to activate policy enforcement tables:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d ncadbook_db -f backend/migrations/007_add_policy_enforcement.sql
```

üöÄ NEXT PHASE (Phase 3 - UX/Design Overhaul):
1. Set up Playwright MCP for visual testing
2. Apply "bold and curious" design system across all 4 portals
3. Implement Phase I Foundation from context/implementation-roadmap.md
4. Desktop-first (1440px), then mobile adaptation
5. Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (tested via a11y-audit.spec.js)

üé® DESIGN CONTEXT (reference before UI work):
- context/design-principles.md - "Bold & Curious" philosophy
- context/style-guide.md - Typography, colors, spacing, components
- context/ux-patterns.md - Booking flow best practices

üìä SUCCESS METRICS:
- 75% reduction in admin time
- 80%+ booking completion rate
- 20%+ equipment utilization increase
- Page load < 2 seconds (improve from current < 3s)
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

MY GOAL FOR THIS SESSION:
[Describe what you want to work on]

Please confirm you've reviewed the checkpoint and are ready to proceed.

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Database Not Connecting:
```bash
sc query postgresql-x64-18      # Check if running
sc start postgresql-x64-18      # Start if stopped
psql -U postgres -d ncadbook_db -c "SELECT 1;"  # Test connection
```

### Port Already in Use:
```bash
# Frontend (5175)
netstat -ano | findstr :5175
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Backend (3001)
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Tests Failing:

## Emergency Recovery

### If Something Broke:

1. **Check git status first:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff
   ```

2. **Restore last working state:**
   ```bash
   git stash                    # Save current changes
   git checkout master          # Go to master
   git pull origin master       # Get latest
   git stash pop               # Restore changes (optional)
   ```

3. **Nuclear option (lose all changes):**
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD       # Discard all uncommitted changes
   git clean -fd               # Remove untracked files
   ```

4. **If database is corrupted:**
   - Restore from backup (see BACKUP_RESTORE_GUIDE.md)
   - Or re-run all migrations in order (001 through 007)
