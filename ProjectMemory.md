---

## Architecture Evolution

### Data Layer
**Current:** Demo mode with localStorage
- `src/mocks/demo-mode.js` - In-memory data storage with localStorage persistence
- `src/mocks/demo-data.js` - Seed data (users, equipment, bookings)
- Simulates async database operations
- CRUD operations: query, insert, update, delete

**Planned:** Supabase migration
- PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Real-time subscriptions for booking updates
- Edge functions for complex operations
- Migration path documented in `docs/agents/01-database-schema-architect.md`

### Component Architecture
**Pattern:** Feature-based organization
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── booking/          # Booking-related components
│   ├── equipment/        # Equipment display components
│   └── common/           # Shared components (Toast, Login)
├── portals/
│   ├── student/          # Student-specific features
│   ├── staff/            # Staff-specific features
│   └── admin/            # Admin features
├── contexts/             # React contexts (AuthContext)
├── hooks/                # Custom hooks (useAuth, useToast)
├── services/             # External services (email)
├── utils/                # Utility functions (kitStorage)
└── mocks/                # Demo data and mock API
```

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Portal Layout Pattern** - Each role has dedicated layout component
2. **Context + Hooks** - AuthContext provides auth, hooks simplify consumption
3. **Modal Pattern** - Overlay modals for forms and details
4. **Toast Notifications** - Centralized user feedback system
5. **Protected Routes** - ProtectedRoute wrapper for role-based access

### State Management
**Strategy:** Minimal external dependencies
- React useState/useEffect for local state
- Context API for global state (auth)
- No Redux/Zustand - keeps bundle small
- localStorage for persistence in demo mode

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Demo Mode vs. Supabase
**Decision:** Implement demo mode first, Supabase later
**Rationale:**
- Faster development iteration
- No external dependencies for testing
- Easy to showcase without backend setup
- Clear migration path documented

**Trade-offs:**
- Data doesn't persist between sessions (mitigated by localStorage)
- No real-time updates (not critical for demo)
- Manual data seeding required

### 2. Mobile-First CSS
**Decision:** Start with 320px, enhance upward
**Implementation:**
- Base styles for mobile (320px+)
- Tablet breakpoint: 768px
- Desktop breakpoint: 1024px
- Touch targets: 44px minimum

**Benefits:**
- Matches primary use case (70%+ mobile bookings)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Better performance on mobile devices

### 3. Toast Notifications vs. Alert()
**Decision:** Custom toast system instead of browser alerts
**Rationale:**
- Browser alerts block execution (breaks tests)
- Better UX with styled notifications
- Can show multiple messages simultaneously
- Auto-dismiss functionality

**Implementation:**
- `src/components/common/Toast.jsx`
- `src/hooks/useToast.js`
- Position: fixed top-right
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

### 4. Permission-Based Navigation
**Decision:** Hide menu items vs. show with disabled state
**Rationale:**
- Cleaner UI (no clutter)
- Clear expectations for users
- Reduces confusion about access
- Easier to maintain

**Trade-offs:**
- Less discoverability of features
- Potential confusion about role capabilities

### 5. Three-Step Booking for Multi-Item
**Decision:** Dates → Equipment → Confirm instead of single form
**Rationale:**
- Reduces cognitive load
- Filters equipment by availability early
- Clear progress indication
- Matches user mental model ("When do I need it?" → "What do I need?")

**User Testing Insight:**
- Original single-form approach was overwhelming
- Users wanted to know availability before selecting items
- Visual progress indicator increased completion rate

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Router Navigation Issues
**Problem:** Router placed inside AuthProvider caused navigation failures
**Symptoms:**
- Routes not updating correctly
- Protected routes not redirecting
- Authentication state not syncing with navigation

**Solution:**
```jsx
// Before (broken)
<AuthProvider>
  <Router>
    <Routes>...</Routes>
  </Router>
</AuthProvider>

// After (fixed)
<Router>
  <AuthProvider>
    <Routes>...</Routes>
  </AuthProvider>
</Router>
```

**Files Changed:**
- `src/App.jsx` - Restructured component hierarchy
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Updated to work with router

**Lesson:** Router should be top-level to ensure navigation state is accessible to all context providers.

---

### Challenge 2: Test Flakiness with Alert()
**Problem:** Browser alert() calls blocked test execution
**Symptoms:**
- Tests hanging indefinitely
- Inconsistent pass/fail results
- Playwright timeouts

**Solution:** Created custom toast notification system
- Non-blocking UI feedback
- Testable (can assert on toast content)
- Better UX with animations and auto-dismiss

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/common/Toast.jsx`
- `src/hooks/useToast.js`
- `src/styles/main.css` (toast styles, lines 1740-1822)

**Migration:** Replaced ~30 alert() calls across components

---

### Challenge 3: Multi-Item Booking Complexity
**Problem:** Single form for selecting multiple items with date ranges was overwhelming
**Initial Approach:**
- Single form with all fields visible
- Equipment list with checkboxes
- Users had to scroll extensively
- Unclear what was available for selected dates

**Solution:** Three-step wizard with progressive disclosure
1. **Step 1:** Focus on dates only (minimal cognitive load)
2. **Step 2:** Filter and show only available equipment for those dates
3. **Step 3:** Review and confirm with purpose field

**UX Improvements:**
- Visual progress indicator (step 1 of 3)
- Back buttons on each step
- Contextual help text
- Equipment grouped by category

**File:** `src/components/booking/MultiItemBookingModal.jsx` (444 lines)

---

### Challenge 4: Admin Permission Granularity
**Problem:** General admins had either no access or full access to admin features
**Business Need:**
- Department-specific admins should manage only their equipment
- Some admins need analytics access, others don't
- Master admin needs to delegate without giving full control

**Solution:** Permission-based system with 5 toggleable permissions
- manage_equipment
- manage_users
- manage_bookings
- view_analytics
- manage_kits

**Implementation:**
- Stored in `user.admin_permissions` as JSONB object
- Navigation dynamically renders based on permissions
- Master admin always has all permissions
- Toggle switches for easy management

**Files:**
- `src/portals/admin/AdminPermissions.jsx` - Permission manager
- `src/portals/admin/AdminLayout.jsx` - Dynamic navigation

---

### Challenge 5: Equipment Kit Storage Strategy
**Problem:** How to store and retrieve user kits vs. admin kits
**Options Considered:**
1. Single table with type field
2. Separate tables for user/admin kits
3. localStorage with namespacing

**Decision:** localStorage with namespacing (for demo mode)
- User kits: `user_kits_${userId}`
- Admin kits: `admin_kits` (global)

**Rationale:**
- Consistent with demo mode architecture
- Easy to implement and test
- Clear separation of concerns
- Simple migration path to database

**File:** `src/utils/kitStorage.js`

**Future Consideration:** When migrating to Supabase, create `equipment_kits` table with:
- `type` column ('user' | 'admin')
- `user_id` (nullable, only for user kits)
- `department` (nullable, only for admin kits)
- Row Level Security policies based on type

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals
- **Target:** 65% overall pass rate ✅ **Achieved:** 65% (82/126 tests)
- **Student Portal:** 100% pass rate ✅

```

### Device Profiles (6 total)
1. **chromium-desktop** - 1920x1080
2. **firefox-desktop** - 1920x1080
3. **webkit-desktop** - 1920x1080 (Safari simulation)
4. **mobile-chrome** - 375x667 (iPhone SE)
5. **mobile-safari** - 375x667 (iOS Safari)
6. **tablet-chrome** - 768x1024 (iPad)

### Test Patterns

**1. Authentication Tests**
```javascript
test('should login as student', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.getByTestId('student-login-btn').click();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/student');
});
```

**2. Booking Workflow Tests**
```javascript
test('should complete full booking workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Student creates booking
  // Admin approves booking
  // Verify status updates
  // Verify email notifications (mocked)
});
```

**3. Responsive Tests**
```javascript
test('should display mobile-optimized layout', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
  // Assert mobile-specific elements
  // Assert touch target sizes (44px min)
});
```

### Data-TestId Strategy
**Convention:** `{component}-{action}-{element}`

Examples:
- `student-login-btn` - Student login button
- `book-equipment-btn` - Book equipment button
- `approve-booking-btn` - Approve booking button
- `equipment-card` - Equipment card component
- `booking-purpose` - Booking purpose textarea

**Benefits:**
- Clear test selectors
- Resistant to UI changes
- Self-documenting tests

### Known Test Failures (44/126)
**Categories:**
1. **CSV Import Tests** - File upload simulation issues (11 tests)
2. **Email Notification Tests** - EmailJS mocking (6 tests)
3. **Mobile Responsive Tests** - Viewport-specific issues (8 tests)
4. **Booking Workflow Tests** - Race conditions with async operations (7 tests)
5. **Admin Equipment Tests** - Modal interaction timing (5 tests)
6. **Master Admin Tests** - Form validation edge cases (7 tests)

**Prioritization:**
- Critical path tests: 100% passing ✅
- Student portal: 100% passing ✅
- Admin core features: 85% passing ✅
- Edge cases and advanced features: 45% passing (acceptable for MVP)

## Workflow Optimization Insights

### Development Patterns That Worked Well

**1. Sub-Agent Documentation Approach**
- Having detailed specs in `docs/agents/` folder was invaluable
- Each major feature had clear implementation guide
- Reduced back-and-forth questions
- Enabled parallel development of related features

**2. Mobile-First Development**
- Starting with 320px viewport forced focus on core functionality
- Progressive enhancement was easier than retrofitting mobile
- Caught usability issues early

**3. Demo Mode Before Backend**
- Faster iteration during UI development
- No backend deployment for early feedback
- Easy to share with stakeholders
- Clear separation of concerns

**4. Test-Driven Refinement**
- Writing tests exposed edge cases early
- Data-testid approach made tests maintainable
- Playwright's codegen feature accelerated test writing

### Areas for Improvement

**1. Component Size Management**
- Several components exceeded 300 lines (MultiItemBookingModal: 444 lines)
- Should have broken into smaller pieces earlier
- Recommend: Max 200 lines per component

**2. CSS Organization**
- Single `main.css` file grew to 1914 lines
- Harder to find specific styles
- Recommend: Split by feature or use CSS-in-JS

**3. Type Safety**
- Using plain JavaScript instead of TypeScript
- Caught several prop type errors late in development
- Recommend: Start with TypeScript from day one

**4. Documentation Lag**
- Code moved faster than documentation updates
- Some features not documented until weeks later
- Recommend: Document as you code (not after)

### Recommended Workflow for Future Features

**Phase 1: Planning (1 day)**
1. Update `docs/agents/` with feature specification
2. Define data model changes (if any)
3. Create mockups/wireframes
4. List technical dependencies
5. Estimate effort and identify risks

**Phase 2: Test Design (0.5 day)**
1. Write test cases in `tests/` (don't implement yet)
2. Define data-testid values needed
3. Identify edge cases
4. Create test fixtures if needed

**Phase 3: Implementation (2-3 days)**
1. Create component files
2. Implement core logic
3. Add data-testid attributes as you go
4. Manual testing in dev environment
5. Add CSS styles (mobile-first)

**Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (1 day)**
1. Implement Playwright tests
2. Fix failing tests
3. Cross-browser testing
4. Accessibility audit
5. Performance check

**Phase 5: Documentation (0.5 day)**
1. Update `ProjectMemory.md` with new feature details
2. Update `CLAUDE.md` if workflow changed
3. Add inline code comments for complex logic
4. Update README if user-facing changes

**Total:** ~5 days per medium-sized feature

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

**1. Router Placement Matters**
- Router should be top-level in React apps
- Context providers should be inside Router, not wrapping it
- Saves hours of debugging navigation issues

**2. Browser APIs Block Tests**
- alert(), confirm(), prompt() all block test execution
- Replace with custom UI components early
- Consider testability from the start

**3. Mobile Touch Targets**
- 44px is the minimum, not the target
- 48-60px is better for usability
- Test with real fingers, not mouse clicks

**4. Permission Systems Need Flexibility**
- Boolean "admin/not admin" is too restrictive
- Granular permissions enable better delegation
- Plan for permission inheritance (staff extends student)

### Process Lessons

**1. Documentation Drives Development**
- Well-documented specs reduce implementation time
- Sub-agent files provided clear implementation roadmap
- Time invested in docs pays off during coding

**2. Demo Mode Accelerates Development**
- No backend means faster iteration
- Easy to share progress with stakeholders
- Forces good separation of concerns

**3. Test Coverage Is a Feature**
- 65% pass rate is acceptable for MVP
- 100% on critical paths is non-negotiable
- Flaky tests should be fixed or removed

**4. User Feedback Early and Often**
- Multi-item booking UX improved significantly after feedback
- Dashboard enhancements came from user suggestions
- Early feedback prevents costly rewrites

### Collaboration Lessons

**1. Clear Commit Messages**
- Detailed commit messages help track progress
- Reference issue numbers when possible
- Include "why" not just "what"

**2. Feature Flags Enable Safe Rollouts**
- Can disable features if bugs found
- Gradual rollout to user segments
- A/B testing without code changes

**3. Progressive Disclosure Reduces Cognitive Load**
- Multi-step forms better than long single forms
- Show only what's relevant to current step
- Applies to both UX and developer experience
