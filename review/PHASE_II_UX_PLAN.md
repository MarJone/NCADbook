**Date Started:** October 17, 2025
**Status:** üöÄ IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Implement "bold and curious" visual design enhancements

---

## Current System Analysis

### What's Already Good ‚úÖ
1. **Design System Foundation** - 100% token-based, ready for enhancements
2. **Card Component System** - Portal-aware, token-based, well-structured
3. **Equipment Browse** - Functional grid/list views, search, filters
4. **Accessibility** - 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained

### What Needs Enhancement üé®

#### 1. Equipment Browse Page (EquipmentBrowse.jsx)
**Current Issues:**
- Inline styles throughout (lines 254, 260, 278-287, 290-305, etc.)
- No hover state micro-interactions
- Missing Quick View modal
- Filter UI not sticky/optimized
- No loading animations beyond skeleton

**Planned Enhancements:**
- [x] Extract all inline styles to CSS classes

- [ ] Make filter sidebar sticky on desktop
- [ ] Add fade-in animations for equipment grid
- [ ] Enhance status badges with icons

#### 2. Equipment Cards
**Current Issues:**

#### 6. Micro-Interactions
**Missing:**

- [ ] 100% design token usage for new features
- [ ] 0 accessibility violations maintained
- [ ] <200ms transition durations
- [ ] Quick View modal accessible (keyboard + screen reader)

### Qualitative

- [ ] Hover states are smooth and delightful
- [ ] Booking flow feels guided and clear
- [ ] Micro-interactions add polish without distraction
- [ ] System feels more "bold and curious"

---

## Technical Approach

### CSS Architecture
- Add new classes to existing CSS files
- Maintain design system token usage
- Use portal-specific classes where needed
- Ensure responsive behavior (mobile-first)

### Component Structure
```
src/components/equipment/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EquipmentQuickView.jsx (NEW)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EquipmentCard.jsx (NEW - extracted from EquipmentBrowse)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AvailabilityIndicator.jsx (NEW)

src/components/booking/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BookingProgress.jsx (NEW)

src/styles/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ equipment-browse.css (NEW)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ equipment-quick-view.css (NEW)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ booking-progress.css (NEW)
```

### Animation Strategy
- Use CSS transitions (not JavaScript)
- GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity)
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Keep durations fast (200-300ms)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Accessibility Risks
- **Risk:** New animations violate reduced-motion preference
- **Mitigation:** Always include `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`

- **Risk:** Quick View modal not keyboard accessible
- **Mitigation:** Test with keyboard-only navigation, add ARIA labels

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** Hover animations cause jank
- **Mitigation:** Use GPU properties only, test on low-end devices

### UX Risks
- **Risk:** Quick View modal adds friction instead of reducing it
- **Mitigation:** Ensure it loads instantly, close on ESC, click outside

## Testing Plan

### Visual Testing (Playwright)
1. Take screenshots before enhancements
2. Implement enhancements
3. Take screenshots after
4. Compare across all portals (Student, Staff, Dept Admin, Master Admin)
5. Test mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)

### Accessibility Testing
1. Run `accessibility-audit.js` after each enhancement
2. Keyboard navigation test (Tab, Enter, Escape)
3. Screen reader test (NVDA)
4. High contrast mode test

### Cross-Browser Testing
1. Chrome (primary)
2. Firefox
3. Safari
4. Edge
