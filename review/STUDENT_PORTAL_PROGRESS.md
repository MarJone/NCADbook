- üìã Transfer to other 3 portals
- üìã Final system-wide testing

**Benefits:**
- Faster iteration (single codebase)
- Cleaner testing (no duplication)
- Find bugs in 1 place first
- Easier bulk transfer later

## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements (Today)

### 1. Phase II-A through II-D (Previously Completed)
- ‚úÖ Equipment Browse CSS (450+ lines, all inline styles removed)
- ‚úÖ Quick View Modal (140 lines JSX + 360 lines CSS)
- ‚úÖ Booking Progress Indicator (54 lines JSX + 320 lines CSS)

  disabled={loading}
>
  Book Multiple Items
</button>
```

  action={
    searchQuery || filter !== 'all' || departmentFilter !== 'all' ? (
      <button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={handleClearAllFilters}>
        Clear All Filters
      </button>
    ) : null
  }
/>
```

- Only shows when not loading

**Code:**
```jsx
{!loading && (

  </div>
)}
```
