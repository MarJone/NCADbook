# Phase 3: Admin Booking Approval System - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete booking approval workflow with mobile-first swipe actions, bulk operations, and real-time statistics integration. Admins can now efficiently approve or deny student booking requests directly from the dashboard.

## Completed Work

### 1. Booking Approvals Dashboard ✅

#### Updated Components

**BookingApprovals.jsx** ([src/portals/admin/BookingApprovals.jsx](src/portals/admin/BookingApprovals.jsx))
- ✅ Replaced `demoMode` with `bookingsAPI`
- ✅ Real-time booking data from PostgreSQL
- ✅ Role-based filtering (backend handles department restrictions)
- ✅ Enriched booking data (student info, equipment details)

**Key Features:**
- **Status Filters:** Pending, Approved, Denied, Cancelled, All
- **Search:** Equipment name, student name/email, purpose
- **Pagination:** 20 bookings per page
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Mobile-friendly data refresh
- **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders during fetch

### 2. Approval Actions ✅

#### Single Booking Actions
```javascript
// Approve booking
await bookingsAPI.approve(bookingId);

// Deny booking with reason
await bookingsAPI.deny(bookingId, reason);
```

#### Bulk Actions
- **Select All:** Checkbox to select all bookings on current page
- **Bulk Approve:** Approve multiple bookings at once
- **Bulk Deny:** Deny multiple bookings with single reason
- **Visual Feedback:** Loading states, progress indicators

#### Email Notifications
- ✅ Approval confirmation sent to student
- ✅ Denial notification with reason
- ✅ Equipment details included
- ✅ Booking dates and purpose
- ⚠️ EmailJS integration (existing code, needs configuration)

### 3. Mobile-First Swipe Actions ✅

**SwipeActionCard Component** (existing)
- Swipe right → Approve (green)
- Swipe left → Deny (red)
- Tap for details
- Checkbox for bulk selection
- Touch-optimized (44px minimum)

**Booking Card Display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ □  📷 Canon EOS R5              │
│    John Smith (john@ncad.ie)    │
│    📅 Oct 15 - Oct 20, 2025     │
│    Purpose: Final year project  │
│    ⏳ Pending                    │
│    [Approve] [Deny]              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4. Staff Dashboard Integration ✅

**StaffDashboard.jsx** ([src/portals/staff/StaffDashboard.jsx](src/portals/staff/StaffDashboard.jsx))
- ✅ Replaced `demoMode` with `bookingsAPI` and `equipmentAPI`
- ✅ Real-time statistics from backend
- ✅ Clickable "Pending Approvals" card (highlighted in orange when > 0)
- ✅ Department equipment count
- ✅ Available equipment count

**New Stats Display:**
```javascript
{
  myBookings: 5,              // User's active bookings
  pendingApprovals: 12,       // Bookings awaiting approval (admins only)
  departmentEquipment: 52,    // Total equipment in department
  availableEquipment: 38      // Currently available
}
```

**Role-Based Visibility:**
- **Students:** See only "My Bookings"
- **Staff:** See "Pending Approvals" + department stats
- **Dept Admin:** See "Pending Approvals" (filtered to department)
- **Master Admin:** See "Pending Approvals" (all departments)

### 5. Backend API Integration

**Endpoints Used:**
```
GET  /api/bookings?status=pending          # Load pending bookings
PUT  /api/bookings/:id/approve             # Approve booking
PUT  /api/bookings/:id/deny                # Deny booking
GET  /api/equipment?department=MID         # Department equipment
```

**Response Mapping:**
```javascript
// Backend response
{
  bookings: [{
    id: 1,
    user_id: 5,
    user_name: "John Smith",
    user_email: "john@ncad.ie",
    user_department: "Moving Image Design",
    equipment_id: 10,
    equipment_name: "Canon EOS R5",
    equipment_category: "Camera",
    equipment_department: "Moving Image Design",
    start_date: "2025-10-15",
    end_date: "2025-10-20",
    status: "pending",
    purpose: "Final year thesis project"
  }]
}

// Frontend mapping
{
  ...booking,
  equipment: {
    id: equipment_id,
    product_name: equipment_name,
    category: equipment_category,
    department: equipment_department
  },
  student: {

## Database Verification

### Check Approval Records
```sql
-- Connect to database
psql -U ncadbook_user -d ncadbook_db

-- View approved bookings
SELECT
  b.id,
  b.status,
  b.start_date,
  b.end_date,
  b.approved_at,
  u_student.full_name as student,
  u_admin.full_name as approved_by_admin,
  e.product_name as equipment
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u_student ON b.user_id = u_student.id
LEFT JOIN users u_admin ON b.approved_by = u_admin.id
JOIN equipment e ON b.equipment_id = e.id
WHERE b.status = 'approved'
ORDER BY b.approved_at DESC;

-- View denied bookings with reasons
SELECT
  b.id,
  b.status,
  u.full_name as student,
  e.product_name as equipment,
  b.denial_reason
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
JOIN equipment e ON b.equipment_id = e.id
WHERE b.status = 'denied'
ORDER BY b.updated_at DESC;

-- View admin audit trail
SELECT
  a.action_type,
  a.target_type,
  a.target_id,
  a.details,
  a.created_at,
  u.full_name as admin
FROM admin_actions a
JOIN users u ON a.admin_id = u.id
WHERE a.target_type = 'booking'
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## API Testing (Manual)

### Get Pending Bookings
```bash
# Login as admin
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/demo-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"master_admin"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Get pending bookings
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3001/api/bookings?status=pending" | jq
```

### Approve Booking
```bash
# Approve booking ID 1
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/bookings/1/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq
```

### Deny Booking
```bash
# Deny booking ID 2
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/bookings/2/deny \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason":"Equipment under maintenance"}' | jq
```

## Performance Metrics

### Data Protection
✅ Tracking numbers hidden from students (backend filters)
✅ Students cannot see other students' booking requests
✅ Email addresses visible only to admins
✅ Purpose field visible to admins for validation

- ✅ Hover states for clickable elements
- ✅ Multi-column grid for faster scanning

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions
- ✅ Loading skeletons during fetch
- ✅ Progress indicators for bulk operations
- ✅ Color-coded status badges (pending = orange, approved = green, denied = red)

### Configuration (Required)
1. Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com/
2. Create email service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. Create email templates (approval, denial)
4. Add to `.env`:

## Known Issues / Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Email Config:** Requires EmailJS setup (not included in backend)
2. **Bulk Operations:** Sequential API calls (could be optimized with batch endpoint)
3. **Real-time Updates:** No WebSocket (requires manual refresh)
4. **Booking History:** No "Completed" status tracking (return process not implemented)

### Phase 4 Priorities
1. **Equipment Return Workflow**
   - Mark booking as "returned"
   - Late return penalties
   - Equipment condition notes

2. **Advanced Filters**
   - Date range filter
   - Equipment category filter
   - Student search by department

3. **Booking Analytics**
   - Most requested equipment
   - Approval/denial rates
   - Average approval time

4. **Notification System**
   - In-app notifications
   - Push notifications (PWA)
   - SMS integration (Twilio)
