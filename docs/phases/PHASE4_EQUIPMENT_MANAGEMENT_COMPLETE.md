# Phase 4: Equipment Management System - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete equipment management system with backend API integration, equipment notes system, status management, and role-based permissions. Admins can now efficiently manage equipment inventory, track maintenance notes, and update equipment status.

## Completed Work

### 1. Equipment Management Dashboard ✅

#### Updated Components

**EquipmentManagement.jsx** ([src/portals/admin/EquipmentManagement.jsx](src/portals/admin/EquipmentManagement.jsx))
- ✅ Replaced `demoMode` with `equipmentAPI`
- ✅ Real-time equipment data from PostgreSQL (52 items)
- ✅ Role-based filtering (dept admins see only their department)
- ✅ Toast notifications for all actions

**Key Features:**
- **Search:** Equipment name, tracking number, category, description
- **Filters:** All, Available, Booked, Maintenance
- **Status Management:** Dropdown with 4 states
- **Department Assignment:** Master admin can reassign equipment
- **Pagination:** 20 items per page
- **Equipment Details Modal:** Full equipment info + notes

### 2. Equipment Notes System ✅

#### Backend Endpoints ([backend/src/controllers/equipmentController.js](backend/src/controllers/equipmentController.js))

**New Functions:**
```javascript
// GET /api/equipment/:id/notes
export const getEquipmentNotes

// POST /api/equipment/:id/notes
export const addEquipmentNote

// DELETE /api/equipment/:id/notes/:noteId
export const deleteEquipmentNote
```

**Features:**
- **Note Types:** maintenance, damage, usage, general
- **Admin Only:** Students blocked (403 error)
- **Audit Trail:** All note operations logged to `admin_actions`
- **Join Query:** Returns notes with creator names
- **Validation:** Note type must be valid, content required

#### Frontend Component ([src/components/equipment/EquipmentNotes.jsx](src/components/equipment/EquipmentNotes.jsx))
- ✅ Backend API integration (`equipmentAPI.getNotes`, `equipmentAPI.addNote`)
- ✅ Color-coded note types (maintenance=blue, damage=red, usage=green, general=gray)
- ✅ Note icons for quick identification
- ✅ Creator name and timestamp display
- ✅ Add note modal with type selection
- ✅ Error handling with inline alerts
- ✅ Loading states

### 3. Equipment Routes ✅

#### Updated Routes ([backend/src/routes/equipmentRoutes.js](backend/src/routes/equipmentRoutes.js))
```javascript
// Equipment notes routes
router.get('/:id/notes', authenticate, requireAdmin, getEquipmentNotes);
router.post('/:id/notes', authenticate, requireAdmin, addEquipmentNote);
router.delete('/:id/notes/:noteId', authenticate, requireAdmin, deleteEquipmentNote);
```

### 4. Role-Based Permissions ✅

**Department Admin:**
- View only their department's equipment
- Update equipment status
- Add/view notes for their department
- Cannot change department assignment

**Master Admin:**
- View all equipment (all departments)
- Update equipment status
- Change equipment department
- Add/view/delete notes for any equipment
- Full access to all operations

**Students:**
- Can browse equipment list
- Cannot access equipment management page
- Cannot view/add notes (403 blocked)

## Database Schema

### Equipment Notes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE equipment_notes (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  equipment_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES equipment(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  note_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (note_type IN ('maintenance', 'damage', 'usage', 'general')),
  note_content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_by INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_equipment_notes_equipment_id ON equipment_notes(equipment_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_equipment_notes_created_by ON equipment_notes(created_by);
```

### Admin Actions (Audit Trail)
```sql
-- All note operations logged
INSERT INTO admin_actions (admin_id, action_type, target_type, target_id, details)
VALUES (5, 'create', 'equipment_note', 10, '{"equipment_id": 3, "note_type": "maintenance"}');
```

## How to Test

### 1. Equipment Management Dashboard

**Login as Dept Admin:**
```bash
# Open browser
http://localhost:5174/NCADbook/

# Click "Department Admin" quadrant
# Navigate to "Equipment Management"
```

**Expected:**
- See equipment list (filtered to department)
- Search works
- Status filters work
- Can update equipment status
- Cannot change department (dropdown disabled)

**Login as Master Admin:**
```bash
# Click "Master Admin" quadrant
# Navigate to "Equipment Management"
```

**Expected:**
- See ALL equipment (52 items across all departments)
- Can change equipment department
- Full access to all features

### 2. Equipment Notes System

**Add Note:**
1. Click "View Details" on any equipment
2. Scroll to "Equipment Notes" section
3. Click "+ Add Note"
4. Select note type (maintenance, damage, usage, general)
5. Enter note content
6. Click "Add Note"

**Expected:**
- Note appears in list immediately
- Color-coded by type
- Shows your name and timestamp
- Backend logs action to `admin_actions` table

### 3. Status Management

**Update Status:**
1. In equipment table, find status dropdown
2. Select new status (available, booked, maintenance, out_of_service)
3. Dropdown changes automatically

**Expected:**
- Toast notification "Equipment status updated"
- Equipment list refreshes
- Status persists in database
- Filter by new status works

### 4. Department Assignment (Master Admin Only)

**Change Department:**
1. Login as Master Admin
2. In equipment table, find department dropdown
3. Select new department
4. Dropdown changes automatically

**Expected:**
- Toast notification "Equipment department updated"
- Equipment moves to new department
- Dept admins of new department can now see it

  }' | jq
```

## Database Verification

### Check Equipment Notes
```sql
-- Connect to database
psql -U ncadbook_user -d ncadbook_db

-- View all notes
SELECT
  en.id,
  en.note_type,
  en.note_content,
  en.created_at,
  e.product_name as equipment,
  u.full_name as created_by
FROM equipment_notes en
JOIN equipment e ON en.equipment_id = e.id
JOIN users u ON en.created_by = u.id
ORDER BY en.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Notes by type
SELECT note_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM equipment_notes
GROUP BY note_type
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Equipment with most notes
SELECT
  e.product_name,
  COUNT(en.id) as note_count
FROM equipment e
LEFT JOIN equipment_notes en ON e.id = en.equipment_id
GROUP BY e.id, e.product_name
ORDER BY note_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Admin Actions (Audit Trail)
```sql
-- View note-related actions
SELECT
  a.action_type,
  a.target_type,
  a.target_id,
  a.created_at,
  u.full_name as admin,
  a.details
FROM admin_actions a
JOIN users u ON a.admin_id = u.id
WHERE a.target_type = 'equipment_note'
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
