## Slide 1: Title Slide

# NCADbook
## Equipment Booking System for NCAD College

**Transforming Equipment Management**

75% Admin Time Reduction | €60,750/Year Savings | 2-3 Weeks to Launch

[Include NCAD logo]

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome everyone. Today I'll demonstrate NCADbook, our new equipment booking system designed to save 75% of admin time while improving the experience for our 1,600+ students and staff.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

# Current Equipment Booking Process

### ❌ Manual & Time-Consuming
- 10-15 minutes per booking approval
- Email back-and-forth (slow, error-prone)
- Excel spreadsheets with no real-time visibility
- No mobile access

### 📊 The Cost
- **2,600 hours/year** spent on manual bookings
- **€65,000/year** in admin time
- **30% equipment underutilization** (sitting unused)
- Student frustration with slow approvals

**Speaker Notes:**
Currently, admins spend 10-15 minutes per booking managing Excel spreadsheets and email chains. This costs NCAD €65,000/year in admin time alone, not counting the 30% of equipment sitting unused because students don't know what's available.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

## Slide 18: Implementation Timeline

# 2-3 Weeks to Full Production

### 📅 Week 1: Infrastructure Setup
- **Day 1-2:** Database setup (Supabase cloud or NCAD servers)
- **Day 3:** Run database migration scripts
- **Day 4:** Configure authentication (SSO if needed)
- **Day 5:** Configure email service (NCAD SMTP)

### 📅 Week 2: Data Migration & Testing
- **Day 1-2:** Import student roster (CSV or API sync)
- **Day 3-4:** Import equipment catalog with tracking numbers
- **Day 5:** User acceptance testing (UAT) with pilot group

### 📅 Week 3: Pilot & Launch
- **Day 1-3:** Soft launch with ONE department (Communication Design recommended)
- **Day 4:** Gather feedback, address bugs
- **Day 5:** Full launch to all 10 departments

### 🔄 Ongoing Support
- **Week 4:** Monitor usage, provide support
- **Month 2:** Gather feedback, iterate on features
- **Month 3:** Phase out manual Excel system

**Speaker Notes:**
From approval to full launch: just 2-3 weeks. We start with a pilot department (recommended: Communication Design) for 2-4 weeks, gather feedback, then roll out to all departments.

---

## Slide 19: Pilot Strategy

# Recommended Pilot Approach

### 🎯 Pilot Department Selection
**Recommended:** Communication Design or Graphic Design
- **Medium-sized** - Not too small, not too large
- **Tech-savvy students** - Quick adoption
- **Active equipment usage** - Sufficient data for testing
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks

### ✅ Pilot Success Criteria
- ✅ Admin time reduced by **50%+** (target: 75%)
- ✅ Student satisfaction **80%+**
- ✅ Equipment utilization **+10%** (target: 20%)
- ✅ Less than 5 critical bugs found
- ✅ Positive admin feedback

### 🔄 Parallel Operation
- **Weeks 1-4:** Both NCADbook AND Excel available (zero risk)
- **Weeks 5-8:** NCADbook primary, Excel backup (low risk)
- **Week 9+:** NCADbook only, Excel deprecated

### 📊 Rollback Plan
If critical issues: revert to Excel (1 hour), export all data, fix issues, re-launch

**Speaker Notes:**
We strongly recommend starting with one pilot department. Run both systems in parallel for 2-4 weeks - zero risk. If it works well (which we're confident it will), roll out to all departments.

## Slide 22: Return on Investment (ROI)

# €60,750/Year Savings | <1 Week Payback

### 📊 Current Manual System Costs
- **Admin time:** 2,600 hours/year (13 admins × 5 hrs/week × 40 weeks)
- **Admin hourly rate:** €25/hour (average)
- **Annual cost:** 2,600 × €25 = **€65,000/year**

### ⚡ With NCADbook (75% Time Reduction)
- **Admin time:** 650 hours/year (75% reduction)
- **Annual cost:** 650 × €25 = **€16,250/year**
- **Savings:** €65,000 - €16,250 = **€48,750/year** 💰

### 📈 Equipment Utilization Increase (20%)
- **Current equipment value:** €200,000 (200 items × €1,000 avg)
- **Underutilized:** ~30% (€60,000 sitting unused)
- **Increased bookings:** 20% more utilization
- **Effective value gain:** **€12,000/year**

### 🎯 Total Annual Benefit
**€48,750 + €12,000 = €60,750/year**

### 📈 ROI Calculation
- **Year 1 cost:** €0 - €2,420 (depending on hosting + integrations)
- **Year 1 benefit:** €60,750
- **Net savings:** €58,330 - €60,750
- **ROI:** **2,400% - 20,000%** (24x - 200x return!)
- **Payback period:** **<1 week** 🚀

**Speaker Notes:**
The numbers speak for themselves. Even with custom integrations and cloud hosting, NCADbook pays for itself in less than one week. After that, it's pure savings - €60,750 every year.

## Slide 25: Risk Mitigation

# Addressing Common Concerns

### ❓ "What if the system goes down?"
- **On-campus hosting** - Full control, can set up redundancy
- **99.9% uptime target** - Industry standard
- **Fallback plan** - Manual process temporarily available
- **Backup strategy** - Daily database backups, 30-day retention

### ❓ "What if students/staff don't adopt it?"
- **Zero training needed** - Intuitive interface (if you can use Instagram...)
- **Mobile-first** - Matches how students already work
- **Pilot approach** - Test with one department, prove value
- **Parallel operation** - Run both systems for 2-4 weeks (zero risk)
- **Eventually mandatory** - After 4 weeks, bookings ONLY via NCADbook

### ❓ "What if we need custom features?"
- **Flexible system** - Built to accommodate NCAD-specific needs
- **Feature request process** - Submit via in-app form, reviewed monthly
- **Open to customization** - Custom fields, workflows, reports
- **Development support** - €50-100/hour for custom features

### ❓ "What about data security?"
- **Enterprise-grade encryption** - TLS 1.3, AES-256
- **GDPR compliant** - Right to export, right to deletion
- **Audit logging** - Full transparency on data access
- **Regular security audits** - Quarterly reviews

### ❓ "What's the rollback plan?"
- **Phases 1-4 weeks:** Both systems running (zero risk)
- **Emergency rollback:** Revert to Excel in 1 hour
- **Data export:** All NCADbook data exportable to CSV
- **Post-mortem:** Identify issues, fix, re-launch

**Speaker Notes:**
We've thought through every risk. On-campus hosting gives full control. Pilot approach minimizes risk. If anything goes wrong, we can revert to Excel in 1 hour with zero data loss.
