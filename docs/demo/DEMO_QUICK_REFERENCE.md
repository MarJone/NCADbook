## 🚨 Demo Troubleshooting

### Issue: Strike Management Not Visible
**Cause:** Component not in navigation yet
**Fix:** Components exist at:
- Admin: `src/portals/demo/StudentStrikesDemo.jsx`
- Student: `src/components/student/StrikeStatusDemo.jsx`
**Workaround:** Show components separately or integrate live

### Issue: No Strike Data
**Cause:** localStorage cleared
**Fix:** Refresh page → Data auto-initializes

### Issue: Server Not Running
**Fix:** `npm run dev` (port 5178)

## 🎯 Demo Talking Points

### Problem Solved
"Late equipment returns are a major issue. Currently, there's no automatic penalty system. Students can repeatedly return equipment late without consequences."

### Solution
"We've implemented a 3-strike system that automatically tracks late returns and applies escalating restrictions. This encourages timely returns while giving students fair warning."

### How It Works
1. Equipment returned late → Automatic strike issued
2. Strike 1 → Warning (educate student)
3. Strike 2 → 7-day booking ban (immediate consequence)
4. Strike 3 → 30-day ban (serious penalty)
5. Semester reset → Fresh start for all students

### Benefits
- ✅ Automated enforcement (no manual tracking)
- ✅ Fair warning system (3 chances)
- ✅ Transparent (students see their strikes)
- ✅ Admin control (can revoke erroneous strikes)
- ✅ Analytics ready (track trends by department)
