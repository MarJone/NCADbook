## üåê **GENERAL QUESTIONS**

### **Q: What is NCADbook?**
**A:** NCADbook is a comprehensive, mobile-first equipment booking and management system designed specifically for NCAD College. It replaces manual Excel-based booking processes with an intuitive digital platform that serves 1,600+ students and staff across 10 departments.

### **Q: Why do we need a new booking system?**
**A:** The current manual process:
- Takes 10-15 minutes per booking for admins
- Has no real-time availability visibility for students
- Relies on email back-and-forth (slow, error-prone)
- Provides no analytics or utilization data
- Difficult to use on mobile devices

NCADbook **reduces admin time by 75%**, increases equipment utilization by 20%, and provides a mobile-first experience that students expect.

### **Q: Who can use NCADbook?**
**A:** The system supports **9 user roles**:

**Primary Roles:**
1. **Students** (1,600 users) - Browse equipment, create bookings, track reservations
2. **Staff** (10+ users) - Equipment management, room bookings, analytics
3. **Department Admins** (13 users) - Approve bookings, manage equipment, cross-dept access
4. **Master Admin** (1-2 users) - System-wide control, user management, settings

**Specialized Roles** (optional, can be enabled/disabled):
5. **View-Only Staff** - Read-only catalog access for teaching faculty
6. **Accounts Officer** - Financial reporting and cost analysis
7. **Payroll Coordinator** - Staff time tracking and payroll integration
8. **IT Support Technician** - Equipment lifecycle and maintenance management
9. **Budget Manager** - Budget forecasting and ROI analytics

### **Q: Is the demo fully functional?**
**A:** Yes! The demo runs in **"Demo Mode"** which means:
- ‚úÖ All features work exactly as they would in production
- ‚úÖ Uses browser localStorage instead of a database (no setup required)
- ‚úÖ Includes 150 demo users and 150 equipment items
- ‚úÖ All 9 portals accessible with test credentials
- ‚úÖ Bookings, approvals, analytics - everything functional

The only difference between demo and production is the data storage location.

### **Q: How long is the demo available?**
**A:** The demo is available:
- **Locally:** As long as the dev server is running
- **Online:** Deployed to GitHub Pages at https://marjone.github.io/NCADbook/

In fact, we expect **70%+ of bookings** to happen on mobile devices.

### **Q: How do I book equipment?**
**A:** Easy 4-step process:
1. **Browse Equipment** ‚Üí Filter by department/category
2. **Click "Book Now"** on available equipment
3. **Select dates** (start and end date)
4. **Write purpose** (e.g., "Final year project photography")
5. **Submit** ‚Üí Booking goes to department admin for approval

Total time: **~60 seconds**

### **Q: How do I know if my booking was approved?**
**A:** You'll receive **email notifications** at every step:
- ‚úÖ Booking submitted (confirmation)
- ‚úÖ Booking approved (with pickup details)
- ‚úÖ Booking denied (with reason)
- ‚ùå Pickup reminder (day before)
- ‚ùå Return reminder (on return date)

You can also check "My Bookings" anytime to see the status (Pending/Approved/Denied).

### **Q: Can I book multiple pieces of equipment at once?**
**A:** Yes! The **Multi-Item Booking** feature lets you:
1. Select dates first
2. See only equipment available for those dates
3. Check multiple items to add to booking
4. Submit all in one go

Perfect for projects requiring a camera, microphone, and lighting kit together.

### **Q: What if the equipment I need is already booked?**
**A:** The system shows **real-time availability**:
- **Red badge** = Currently booked for your selected dates
- **Green badge** = Available

You can:
- Choose different dates when it's available
- Check "Booking History" to see when it'll be free
- Browse alternative equipment in the same category
- Request cross-department access if similar equipment exists elsewhere

### **Q: Can I cancel a booking?**
**A:** Yes, if it's still **Pending** approval, you can cancel anytime from "My Bookings".

If it's already **Approved**, contact the department admin directly (cancellation policies may apply).

### **Q: What happens if I return equipment late?**
**A:** The system has a **3-strike policy**:
- **Strike 1:** Warning email + 1-week booking suspension
- **Strike 2:** 2-week suspension + mandatory meeting with admin
- **Strike 3:** Semester-long ban from equipment bookings

**Good news:** Strikes expire after **6 months of good behavior**, so one mistake won't follow you forever.

### **Q: Can I see equipment from other departments?**
**A:** Yes, with permissions:
- **By default:** You see your own department's equipment
- **Toggle "All Departments":** See equipment from other departments (if cross-department access is enabled)
- **Request Access:** If you need equipment from another department, request permission via the portal

Department admins control cross-department access based on NCAD policies.

- Add multi-field notes (maintenance, damage, usage, general)
- Delete equipment (with confirmation)

All changes are logged with timestamp and admin name for audit trail.

### **Q: What are 'Equipment Notes' and who can see them?**
**A:** Equipment notes are **admin-only** annotations with 4 types:

1. **Maintenance Notes:** "Sensor cleaned, firmware updated to v2.3"
2. **Damage Notes:** "Small scratch on LCD - functional but note for insurance"
3. **Usage Notes:** "Best for outdoor shoots - weather sealed body"
4. **General Notes:** "Includes 3 batteries, 64GB SD card, and case"

**Who sees them:**
- ‚úÖ Department admins (all notes)
- ‚úÖ Master admins (all notes)
- ‚ùå Students (NO - they don't see internal notes)
- ‚ùå Staff (unless given explicit permission)

This keeps internal information (damage, issues) separate from public catalog.

### **Q: How do I handle cross-department booking requests?**
**A:** Navigate to **"Access Requests"** or **"Manage Access Requests"**:

1. **View Request:** See staff member, equipment, reason, date range
2. **Approve with Expiry:** Grant access for specified period (e.g., 30 days)
3. **Deny with Reason:** Reject if equipment is high-demand or restricted
4. **Auto-Expiry:** Access automatically revokes after expiry date

This allows controlled sharing while protecting department resources.

### **Q: Can I see analytics for my department?**
**A:** Yes! Navigate to **"Analytics"** to see:
- Equipment utilization rates (% of time booked)
- Booking trends (by week/month)
- Popular equipment (most booked items)

   - Request cross-department access
   - View department notes
   - Export reports
   - Manage student assignments (if applicable)
4. Save changes
5. Audit trail automatically records who changed permissions and when

This gives **granular control** over what staff can do without making them full admins.

### **Q: What if I accidentally approve/deny a booking?**
**A:** Currently, approvals are final. However:
- Master admin can override decisions
- You can contact the student directly to rebook (if denied by mistake)
- Audit log tracks all approvals for accountability

**Future feature:** "Undo approval" within 5-minute window (on roadmap).

### **Q: What's the return on investment (ROI)?**
**A:** Substantial cost savings:

**Current Manual System Costs:**
- **Admin time:** 13 dept admins √ó 5 hours/week √ó 40 weeks/year = **2,600 hours/year**
- **Admin hourly rate:** ‚Ç¨25/hour (average)
- **Annual admin cost:** 2,600 √ó ‚Ç¨25 = **‚Ç¨65,000/year**

**With NCADbook (75% time reduction):**
- **Admin time:** 2,600 √ó 0.25 = **650 hours/year**
- **Annual admin cost:** 650 √ó ‚Ç¨25 = **‚Ç¨16,250/year**
- **Savings:** ‚Ç¨65,000 - ‚Ç¨16,250 = **‚Ç¨48,750/year** üí∞

**Equipment Utilization Increase (20%):**
- **Current equipment value:** ‚Ç¨200,000 (200 items √ó ‚Ç¨1,000 avg)
- **Underutilized:** ~30% (‚Ç¨60,000 sitting unused)
- **Increased bookings:** 20% more utilization
- **Better ROI on equipment:** ‚Ç¨12,000/year effective value gain

**Total Annual Benefit:** ‚Ç¨48,750 + ‚Ç¨12,000 = **‚Ç¨60,750/year**

**ROI Calculation:**
- **Year 1 cost:** ‚Ç¨300 - ‚Ç¨2,420 (depending on hosting choice and custom features)
- **Year 1 benefit:** ‚Ç¨60,750
- **Net savings:** ‚Ç¨58,330 - ‚Ç¨60,450

### **Q: Can students scan QR codes on equipment to check it out?**
**A:** Not yet, but **coming in Q1 2025**:

**Planned QR Code Workflow:**

**Setup:**
- Admin prints QR code labels for each equipment item (generated by system)
- QR code contains equipment ID and tracking number

**Check-Out (Student):**
1. Student opens NCADbook on phone
2. Taps "Scan QR Code" button
3. Scans QR code on equipment
4. System shows equipment details
5. If approved booking exists: "Check Out Now" button
6. Confirms check-out, starts return countdown

**Check-In (Student):**
1. Scan QR code again
2. "Check In Now" button appears
3. Confirm check-in
4. System prompts for condition report (optional)
5. Upload damage photos if needed

**Benefits:**
- **Faster check-out/in** (10 seconds vs 2 minutes)
- **Reduced admin workload** (self-service)
- **Accurate tracking** (timestamp, location via phone GPS)
- **Condition reporting** (photos, notes at check-in)

**Development Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (camera permissions, QR library, workflow testing)

### **Q: Will this support room/studio bookings beyond equipment?**
**A:** Already partially supported, expanding in **Q1 2025**:

**Current (Available Now):**
- ‚úÖ Staff portal has room booking functionality

- ‚¨ú Room calendar view (see all bookings at a glance)
- ‚¨ú Room photos and floor plans
- ‚¨ú Student access to room bookings (currently staff-only)

**Use Cases:**
- Editing suite bookings (Media department)
- Photography studio bookings
- Workshop space bookings (Sculpture, Print)
- Computer lab bookings
- Project space bookings

### **Q: Can the system suggest equipment based on project needs?**
**A:** Not yet, but **on backlog** (priority TBD):

**Planned "Smart Recommendations" Feature:**

**How It Works:**
1. Student describes project: "I'm filming a documentary outdoors"
2. AI suggests equipment bundle:
   - Canon EOS R5 (weather-sealed camera)
   - Shotgun microphone (outdoor audio)
   - Tripod (stable shots)
   - ND filter (bright sunlight)
   - Extra batteries (long shoot days)
3. Student can book entire bundle in one click

**Data Sources:**
- Past booking patterns (what equipment is often booked together)
- Equipment categories and tags
- Project keywords (indoor/outdoor, video/photo, etc.)
- Admin-curated bundles (recommended setups)

**Benefits:**
- **Better outcomes** (students use right equipment)
- **Reduced back-and-forth** (no "I should have also booked X")
- **Increased utilization** (underused accessories get recommended)

**Challenges:**
- Requires AI/ML integration (complexity)
- Needs large dataset of past bookings (6+ months)
- Risk of over-recommendation (booking unnecessary items)

**Timeline:** Q3 2025 at earliest (lower priority than mobile app, QR codes)
