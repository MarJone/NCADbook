## Recommended Equipment Distribution Strategy

### High-Equipment Departments (40-60 items each)
- **Moving Image Design** - Cameras, lighting, audio, editing workstations
- **Media (Fine Art)** - Video equipment, projectors, sound recording
- **Photography** (if separate) - DSLRs, lenses, lighting kits

### Medium-Equipment Departments (20-40 items each)
- **Graphic Design** - Computers, tablets, printers, scanners
- **Interaction Design** - Laptops, tablets, VR headsets, testing devices
- **Product Design** - 3D printers, tools, modeling equipment

### Lower-Equipment Departments (5-15 items each)
- **Painting** - Projectors, cameras for documentation
- **Print** - Presses (shared), cameras, scanners
- **Sculpture** - Power tools, safety equipment, cameras
- **Fashion & Textiles** - Sewing machines, cameras, mannequins
- **Illustration** - Tablets, scanners, cameras
- **Jewellery** - Cameras, micro cameras, lighting

### Minimal Equipment Departments (1-5 items each)
- **Visual Culture** - Cameras, recording devices for research
- **Education** - Presentation equipment, cameras
- **First Year Core** - Shared pool of basic equipment

## Questions for You

1. **Do you want all 20 departments** or prefer the **simplified 12 departments**?

2. **Should Photography be separate?** It wasn't in the original NCAD structure but is a major equipment category. Options:
   - Keep as part of "Media" (Fine Art)
   - Make it a standalone department
   - Distribute photography equipment across multiple departments

3. **First Year Core equipment access**: Should First Year students:
   - Have their own equipment pool?
   - Access equipment from all departments?
   - Access only basic equipment from a "shared pool"?

4. **Equipment sharing preference**:
   - Some equipment (like cameras) might be used across multiple departments
   - Should we assign equipment to ONE department (cleaner, easier to track)?
   - OR allow equipment to have "primary department" + "accessible by" list?

## Recommended Structure for Equipment Booking System

Based on equipment usage patterns, I recommend **the simplified 12-department structure** because:

✅ Easier for students to navigate (fewer dropdowns)
✅ Clearer equipment ownership (less cross-department confusion)
✅ Simpler for department admins to manage
✅ Still preserves NCAD's academic structure
✅ Better for 150 users / 150 equipment distribution

**Example Distribution (12 departments, 150 equipment):**
- Communication Design: 35 items (cameras, computers, tablets)
- Fashion & Textiles: 15 items (cameras, sewing machines)
- Jewellery & Objects: 8 items (cameras, lighting)
- Interaction Design: 25 items (laptops, tablets, VR)
- Product Design: 20 items (3D printers, tools)
- Painting: 5 items (projectors, cameras)
- Print: 10 items (cameras, scanners)
- Media: 20 items (video, audio, projection)
- Sculpture & Applied Materials: 8 items (tools, cameras)
- Education: 2 items (presentation)
- Visual Culture: 1 item (camera)
- First Year Core: 1 item (shared)

**Total: 150 equipment items**

## Your Decision

Please specify:

1. **Which structure?** (20 departments or 12 departments or custom)
2. **Photography separate?** (Yes/No)
3. **First Year Core access?** (Own pool / All departments / Shared pool)
4. **Equipment assignment?** (Single department / Primary + accessible by)

Once you confirm, I'll:
- Update `departments.js` with final structure
- Distribute 150 users across departments (students, staff, admins)
- Distribute 150 equipment items across departments
- Update all demo data and components
