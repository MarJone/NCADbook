## 🔍 Common Failure Patterns

### 1. **Timeout Issues** (30+ tests)
- Tests waiting 30+ seconds for elements
- Likely missing UI components or slow loading
- **Fix:** Investigate actual UI structure, add data-testid attributes

### 2. **Element Not Found** (15+ tests)
- Selectors not matching actual DOM
- Modal/popup elements not appearing
- **Fix:** Update selectors to match actual implementation

### 3. **Strict Mode Violations** (5+ tests)
- Multiple elements matching same selector
- **Fix:** Use more specific selectors or `.first()`

### 4. **Network/Loading Issues** (5+ tests)
- Pages not fully loading
- **Fix:** Add better wait strategies

---

## 📈 Improvements Made

### Before Fixes:
- **63 tests passing** (50% pass rate)
- Authentication fixtures timing out
- Booking tests all failing

### After Fixes:
- **72 tests passing** (57% pass rate) ⬆️ **+9 tests**
- ✅ Fixed authentication fixtures (regex patterns, networkidle)
- ✅ Fixed booking modal selectors
- ✅ Fixed toast/alert handling
- ✅ Improved navigation handling

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes

1. **Add data-testid Attributes** to React components
   ```jsx
   // Example:
   <div className="equipment-card" data-testid="equipment-card">
   <button className="book-btn" data-testid="book-button">
   <div className="modal" data-testid="booking-modal">
   ```

2. **Investigate Booking Modal**
   - Currently not appearing in tests
   - Check if BookingModal component renders correctly
   - May need to click specific button text

3. **Fix Toast Notifications**
   - App uses `alert()` in some places
   - Consider implementing proper toast component
   - Or update tests to handle alerts

4. **Staff Portal Dashboard**
   - Investigate why dashboard isn't rendering
   - Check routing and component loading

### Medium Priority

1. **CSV Import File Upload**
   - File input not visible in some tests
   - May be hidden behind button click

2. **Email Notification Tests**
   - Review EmailJS mock setup
   - Verify API interception

3. **Booking Workflow Integration**
   - Break down into smaller test cases
   - Add intermediate assertions

### Low Priority

1. **Responsive Design Edge Cases**
   - Network throttling tests
   - Complex viewport scenarios

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Some tests taking 30+ seconds
   - Consider reducing timeout for faster feedback
