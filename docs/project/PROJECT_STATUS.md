## 📱 Mobile-First Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile:** 320px - 768px (single column, large touch targets)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px (2-column grids)
- **Desktop:** 1024px+ (3-column grids, hover states)

### Touch Optimization
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Swipe gestures for booking approval
- Pull-to-refresh on mobile
- Large tap areas for all interactive elements

### Performance
- <3 second load on 3G networks
- Lazy loading for images
- Virtual scrolling for lists (>50 items)
- Debounced search (300ms)

4. **Role-Based Access Control:** Security at database + API layer
5. **Conflict Detection in Backend:** Prevents race conditions

### Development Process
1. **Incremental Phases:** Each phase builds on previous work
2. **Backend First:** API-first approach ensured solid foundation
3. **Documentation:** Comprehensive docs saved time in later phases
4. **Git History:** Clear commit messages help track decisions

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Database Permissions:** Needed careful RLS policy design
2. **Role Filtering:** Backend filtering more secure than frontend
3. **Booking Conflicts:** SQL query for overlap detection
4. **Mobile UX:** Swipe actions needed careful touch event handling
