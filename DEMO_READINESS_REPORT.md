## 🐛 **KNOWN ISSUES & WORKAROUNDS**

### Non-Critical Issues (Safe to Demo)
1. **Bundle size warning (1MB)** - Performance still good, code splitting recommended for future
2. **Some test failures (46/126)** - Demo mode works perfectly, tests need updating for demo data
3. **16 npm vulnerabilities** - Non-blocking, can be addressed post-demo

### Workarounds for Demo
- **If login fails:** Use quadrant click for auto-login instead of manual form
- **If demo data gets messy:** Master Admin → System Settings → "Reset Demo Data"
- **If performance slows:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- **If page doesn't load:** Refresh (F5) or open incognito window

### Not Implemented Yet (Transparently Acknowledge)
- **QR code scanning** - On roadmap for Q1 2025
- **Native mobile apps** - On roadmap for Q2 2025
- **Offline mode** - On roadmap for Q3 2025
- **SMS notifications** - Email only currently (SMS can be added)

**Script for acknowledging:** "That's a great idea! It's actually on our roadmap for [timeframe]. Currently we have [current functionality], and we plan to add [requested feature] in the next phase."

## 💡 **DEMO BEST PRACTICES**

### Before Demo Starts
1. ✅ Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. ✅ Load demo URL and verify login page displays
3. ✅ Open browser console (F12) to monitor for errors
4. ✅ Have DEMO_CREDENTIALS.md open in second window
5. ✅ Test hover effects on login map
6. ✅ Have backup browser tab with portal already logged in
7. ✅ Silence notifications (presentation mode)
8. ✅ Charge laptop / plug in power

### During Demo
1. **Speak to value, not features:** Focus on time savings, ROI, ease of use
2. **Show, don't tell:** Live demo beats screenshots
3. **Mobile is key:** Emphasize mobile-first design (70% of bookings)
4. **Handle questions gracefully:** Use FAQ for answers, defer deep technical questions
5. **Invite hands-on:** Let stakeholders try it themselves after demo

### After Demo
1. ✅ Leave demo open for hands-on exploration
2. ✅ Distribute DEMO_CREDENTIALS.md printout
3. ✅ Send follow-up email with:
   - Demo recording/screenshots
   - FAQ document link
   - Next steps timeline
   - Contact information
4. ✅ Collect feedback forms
5. ✅ Schedule follow-up meetings

## 📈 **SUCCESS METRICS FOR DEMO**

### Positive Indicators
- ✅ Stakeholders asking "When can we deploy this?"
- ✅ IT staff asking technical integration questions
- ✅ Admins testing swipe actions and saying "This is so fast!"
- ✅ Discussion about which department should pilot first
- ✅ Questions about customization and features (means they're envisioning using it)

### Concerning Indicators
- ⚠️ Silence throughout presentation
- ⚠️ Questions only about cost, not about features
- ⚠️ Skepticism about adoption ("Students won't use this")
- ⚠️ Concerns about changing from Excel

### If Demo Isn't Landing Well
**Pivot strategies:**
1. **Show ROI calculation:** €60,750/year savings, <1 week payback
2. **Focus on mobile:** Show how easy it is vs email on phone
3. **Ask directly:** "What would make this system valuable to YOU specifically?"
4. **Compare side-by-side:** Excel manual process (10 min) vs NCADbook (10 sec)
5. **Offer pilot:** "Let's try this with ONE department for 2 weeks - zero risk"
